You're about to initialize a Firebase project in this directory:

  /Users/anshulverma/Desktop/All BitBucket Projects Anshul/Flutter Projects/PracticeProjects/gitFiles/demoFlutterWebPages

Before we get started, keep in mind:

  * You are initializing within an existing Firebase project directory

[info]
